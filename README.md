# Getting Started

Before playing the game, here are the prerequisites or steps that you should follow to setup your device and ensure a smooth experience in playing the game: 

 1. Make sure that you are using Windows 10 or higher that supports WSL. If so, click on the Windows Icon ðŸªŸ and search for **`Command Prompt`** in the Start Menu. Right-click it and select **`Run as administrator`**. Click **`Yes`** to gain rights to install WSL in your computer.

 2.   Install WSL on your computer / PC through **`Command Prompt`** or **`Windows Powershell`**. Type **`wsl --install`** in your terminal. This will install WSL which has the terminal to create the commands needed to run the game. After installing, you may be asked for your username and password. 

 3. In your WSL terminal, type **`sudo apt update`** followed by **`sudo apt install python3.12`** to install Python in your WSL system. To verify if you already installed Python, type **`python3 --version`** in your terminal. It should show you something like **`Python 3.12.7`** in your screen - this means you have Python in version 3.12.7.

 4. Also, type **`pip install pygame`** to install PyGame. This is the third-party library that is utilized for the game program.

 5. Lastly, type **`pip install pytest`** to install PyTest. This is also a third-party library used for testing the functionality of the game program.
